# Lorebook - Mark Lund

## DWDD 3620 Final Project

deployed live at: https://3620-final.vercel.app/

I chose to work with Svelte for this application due to my past experience with it and my preference for its syntax, especially the $: operator for reactivity.

### Features:

1) User can view all entries in the lorebook
2) User can add a new entry
3) User can select a category for the new entry (Character, Location, Other)
4) User can name the entry
5) User can add description text to the entry
6) User can filter displayed entries by category
7) User can delete an entry
8) User can edit the name field of an entry
9) User can edit the description field of an entry
10) User can edit the category of an entry
11) User can sort entries A-Z
12) User can duplicate an entry (the duplicate gains a 2 appended to the entry name, all other data is identical e.g. ‘Dragon 2’)
13) Application displays stats relating to the total # of entries (ex. 12 Characters, 8 locations, 5 other)
14) User can ‘delete all’ and completely wipe their lorebook INCOMPLETE
15) User can edit an overall lorebook title at the top of the page INCOMPLETE
